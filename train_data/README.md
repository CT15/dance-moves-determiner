# Train Data

This is the data used to train each Machine Learning model (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine).
The dancer's name, dance label and the duration of each dance is specified by the `.csv` file name.
During the training process, the data is partitioned into *test* and *train* set. The model is generated
from the *train* set after performing cross validation. F1 score and accuracy score is generated by 
making the generated model predict the dance labels of the *test* set.
