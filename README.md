# dance-moves-prediction

We aim to predict dance moves using a combination of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
(SVM) to get the best possible accuracy. Train and test data are based on the readings obtained
from two sensors (GY-521 MPU6050 3-Axis Acceleration Gyroscope 6DOF Module) attached to the 
dancers wrists. The raw features are Acceleration x, y, z and Rotation x, y, z. There are a
total of 11 dance moves to be classified.

## Resolving Dependencies
1. Create a virtual environment in the directory
  ```shell
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```
2. Activate the virtual environment
  ```shell
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
3. Install all the required dependencies
  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Generating Machine Learning Models
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Resolve all the dependencies
3. Run `python train_random_forest.py` to generate Random Forest model
4. Find the models in `.sav` format in `models` directory
5. Find the training statistics and evaluation results in `eval_results` directory

To generate SVM model, run `python train_svm.py` at Step 3 instead.

Alternatively, run `./fast_generate_models.sh` at Step 3 to generate both models at the same time.

See sample evaluation results [here](https://github.com/CT15/dance-moves-prediction/tree/master/sample_results/eval_results)

**Note that if you run this without GPU, each Machine Learning model takes around 1.5 hours to generate owing 
to the hyperparameter tuning involved. As such, you may want to train the models from a detached session 
of a terminal multiplexer.**

## Plotting Graphs for All Dance Moves
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Resolve all the dependencies
3. Make sure that the code below is commented out in `train_data.py` ðŸ‘Ž
  ```python
    ##### COMMENT OUT THE CODE BELOW BEFORE RUNNING plot.py #####
    df_max_min = prep.flatten(df, interval)
    df_var = prep.flatten(df, 'var', interval)
    df_concat = prep.concat_df(df_max_min, df_var)
    df = prep.append_truth(df_concat, number)
    #############################################################
  ```
4. Run `python plot.py`
5. Find the graphs in `.png` format in `plots` directory

For some reason, adding an additional parameter in the dode to skip Step 3 makes the code runs 99999x slower. ðŸ˜“

See sample plots [here](https://github.com/CT15/dance-moves-prediction/tree/master/sample_results/plots)

## Testing Final Model
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Resolve all the dependencies
3. Generate machine learning models
3. Customise how the models generated are utilised in MLModel class (`test_model/__init__.py` file)
4. Run `python test.py`

Note that final model can be a combination of both Random Forest and SVM.
